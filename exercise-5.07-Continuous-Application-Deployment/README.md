### Exercise: Continuous Application Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) implies the integration of code into a shared repository, where at each push to the
main branch, the code is built and tested. Frequently, the result of CI represents an artifact, or a Docker image.

In this exercise, you will use GitHub Actions to automate the packaging of an application. This is a quite challenging
exercise because you are provided with all the necessary documents, and you will explore some
actions on your own.

Being able to explore documents and tackle tasks independently is important. Take this opportunity and have fun!
However, if you do need some help, feel free to check out the video on the solution page.

Environment Setup

Prepare the GitHub repository and application to test GitHub actions:


Was done | Task List
--- | ---
&#9745; | Create a new Github repository with the name python-helloworld
&#9745; | Copy the python-helloworld application from the course repository https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/tree/main/solutions/lesson1
&#9745; | Create the repository to store the Github Actions using mkdir -p /.github/workflows command.


The solution created in the repository https://github.com/appwebd/python-helloworld
